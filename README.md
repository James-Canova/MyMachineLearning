This repository contains the files (mostly Python files) that are used with my machine learning blog [MyMachineLearning] (www.mymachinelearning.me).

The blog is a record of my projects that I have used to learn the basics of machine learning for control of machinery. 

The projects primarily make use of Jetson Nano (B01).
