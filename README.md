This repository contains the files (mostly Python files) that are used with my machine learning blog: www.mymachinelearning.me.

The blog is a record of my projects that I have used to learn the basics of machine learning for control of machinery. 

The projects primarily make use of Jetson Nano (B01).


Note: I have done my best to given credit in the Python programs to sources.
